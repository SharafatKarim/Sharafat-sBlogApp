- Template GitHub repository: [Webstie as App](https://github.com/SharafatKarim/WebsiteAsApp)

## Overview

The WebsiteAsApp Android Template allows you to quickly convert a website into a native Android application. Users only need to edit a simple configuration file to specify the website URL, written in simple java. The application features a splash screen with loading ability at startup. Feel free to directly implement or modify even further!

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the template into your Android Studio project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SharafatKarim/WebsiteAsApp
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**

   Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project." Navigate to the cloned repository and select the `WebsiteAsApp` directory.

3. **Edit Configuration:**

   Open the `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file and modify the `website_url` string to the URL of the website you want to convert.

   ```xml
   <resources>
       <string name="app_name">WebsiteAsApp</string>
       <string name="website_url">https://www.example.com/</string>
   </resources>
   ```

6. **Change App Icon:**

   Users can change the app icon by replacing the existing icon files located in the app/src/main/res directory. Feel free to simple replace or append!
  > TIP: There are several online generators to automate this process of generating android app icons.
